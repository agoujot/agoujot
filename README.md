Hello, Iâ€™m @agoujot
I like programming (as, I guess, you can tell from by being here) in my free time (that tends to be late).
I usually code in python but I am learning Ocaml.
(Cats are cute.) I use maybe a slight bit too many parentheses. Fortunately, that is not problematic when coding. I'm french, which is why names here and there and comments and the rest are sometimes in french.
I am also here because I have very limited trust in all devices on which I code and I would prefer not to lose hours of work because one of them decides to die.
Have a good day !
