Hello world ! Iâ€™m @agoujot. I like programming (as, I guess, you can tell from by being here) in my free time (that tends to be late, though). I am here because I have very limited trust in all devices on which I code and I would prefer not to lose hours of work because one of them decides to die. Have a good day (or night, or whatever)!
