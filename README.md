Hello world ! Iâ€™m @agoujot. I like programming (as, I guess, you can tell from by being here) in my free time (that tends to be late, though). I usually code in python but I am learning Ocaml (maybe because I love recursivity). I learned programming on france-ioi, and, these days, I am also doing project euler (cats are cute). I maybe - or may not - use too many parentheses. Fortunately, that is not problematic when coding. I'm french, which is why names here and there and comments and the rest are sometimes in french. I am also here because I have very limited trust in all devices on which I code and I would prefer not to lose hours of work because one of them decides to die. Have a good day (or night, or whatever)!
