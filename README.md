Hello world ! Iâ€™m @agoujot. I like programming (as, I guess, you can tell from by being here) in my free time (that tends to be late, though). I usually code in python but I am learning Ocaml (maybe because I love recursivity). I learned programming on france-ioi (you'll still find me there in the help forum), and, these days, I am also doing project euler (I am a cat person, even though it has no link). I maybe (or may not) use too many parentheses. Fortunately, that is not problematic when coding. I'm french, which is why names here and there and comments and the rest are sometimes in french. I am a Wikipedia, Mediawiki and Wikisource editor. I am also here because I have very limited trust in all devices on which I code and I would prefer not to lose hours of work because one of them decides to die. Have a good day (or night, or whatever)!
