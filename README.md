Hi there ! I'm @agoujot. About me: I like programming (as, I guess, you can tell from by being here) in my free time (that tends to be late, though). I like functional programming (long live OCaml), [higher-range outer-totalistic cellular automata](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Higher-range_outer-totalistic_rule) (for fun, not doing research), old poetry (approx 1800-1930), and excessive parentheticals (haven't noticed yet?). Have a good day (or night, or whatever)!
